            Hey there, my name is Jameel and I am a current Computer Science
            student at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus

        <p id="Paragraph">
            I started coding in 2019 using Pascal in secondary school
            and since then I have been on an incredible journey in 
            programming from basic web development to game development
            in Unity to attempting to create Discord Bots. I started 
            5 years ago and here I am today.
